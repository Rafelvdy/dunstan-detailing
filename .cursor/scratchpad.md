## Background and Motivation

The hero section plays a sequence of videos. When one ends and the next begins, a brief grey/blank flash is visible before the new video renders. This degrades perceived quality of the landing experience.

Update — continuous loop requirement:
- The hero should loop continuously through all videos in `sources`, with smooth transitions and no gaps.
- The gallery should feel instant when navigating; next images should be ready without visible loading.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

- Single video element with `src` swapping triggers a re-load, causing a blank frame between sources.
- Current code uses `preload="auto"` on the hero video, but with a single `<video>` this still re-initializes the element on `src` swap, risking a visible flash if the next source isn't render-ready.
- The container/background may show through during swap; if not explicitly set, the browser default can appear grey.
- There is no crossfade; the next video is not guaranteed `canplay`-ready when the swap occurs, especially on slower networks or mobile.
- iOS/Android autoplay constraints require `muted` and `playsInline`; those are already set, but preloading and programmatic play timing still matter.

Code references observed:

```29:58:src/components/sections/hero/hero.tsx
            <video
                ref={videoRef}
                autoPlay
                muted
                loop={false}
                playsInline
                preload="auto"
                className={styles.HeroVideo}
                src={sources[index]}
                onEnded={() => {
                    setIndex((index + 1) % sources.length);
                }}
            />
```

```139:189:src/components/sections/hero/hero.module.css
.HeroVideoContainer {
    position: absolute;
    inset: 0;
    overflow: hidden;
    margin-top: 0;
    background: transparent; // Will be set to solid black in implementation to avoid grey flash
    z-index: 0;
    height: 100%;
}

.HeroVideo {
    height: 100%;
    object-fit: cover;
    width: 100%;
}
```

## High-level Task Breakdown

1) Set explicit background for the video container
- Success criteria:
  - During any load/swap, the background is black (not grey) under the gradient overlay.
  - No layout shifts introduced.

2) Preload hero videos ahead of time
- Approach options:
  - Add `<link rel="preload" as="video" href="/videos/lambo-hero.web.mp4">` and for the other source in `layout.tsx` head.
  - Or include a hidden `<video preload="auto">` for the upcoming source.
- Success criteria:
  - Network panel shows both videos buffered early on first paint.
  - Swap latency reduced to near-zero on typical connections.

3) Implement dual-video crossfade with pre-buffering (preferred) and continuous loop through all sources
- Approach:
  - Maintain two `<video>` elements: one visible (playing), one hidden (next) with `preload="auto"` and listen for `onCanPlay`.
  - Continuously compute `nextIndex = (activeIndex + 1) % sources.length` to loop through all videos.
  - When current nears end, start loading next; on `ended` (or near-end threshold), crossfade opacity from current to next in ~200–400ms.
  - Swap refs/roles and immediately begin preloading the subsequent source in the now-hidden element.
- Success criteria:
  - No grey/blank frame between videos across desktop and mobile.
  - Smooth crossfade with no stutter at 60fps.
  - CPU/GPU usage remains acceptable on mid-range devices.

4) Add `poster` images as graceful fallback
- Use a representative frame for each video to cover any residual first-frame flash.
- Success criteria:
  - If a video is delayed, the poster is shown under the gradient; no grey appears.

5) Guard play-timing with readiness events
- Listen to `loadeddata`/`canplay` on the next video before starting the crossfade.
- Use `requestVideoFrameCallback` (where available) to time the swap just after a rendered frame to avoid tearing.
- Success criteria:
  - No visible stalls when transitioning, even on throttled networks.

6) Fine-tune network and caching (no service worker)
- Ensure static caching for `/public/videos/*` and `/public/images/*` is long-lived; add `Cache-Control` via Next `headers()`.
- Use `next/image` best practices (sizes, priority for first viewport images) and prefetch adjacent carousel images.
- Success criteria:
  - Subsequent visits show immediate transitions from cache.
  - Carousel navigation feels instant for at least the next two items.

Risk/Trade-offs:
- Preloading and dual-video increases memory/bandwidth; acceptable for two short hero clips but should be measured.
- Mobile data concerns: optionally gate preloading to `navigator.connection.saveData !== true` and/or Wi‑Fi.

## Detailed Plan: Scalable Fade-In/Out Crossfade for Hero

### Goals
- Smooth crossfade between any number of videos with no grey/blank frames.
- Automatically scales when adding/removing items from `sources: string[]` and loops continuously.
- Robust on mobile (autoplay, inline, muted), with graceful fallback.

### Architecture
- Two layered `<video>` elements (A and B) inside `.HeroVideoContainer`:
  - Both absolutely positioned, `object-fit: cover`, full-bleed.
  - CSS controls opacity; only one is visible at a time.
  - Container has solid black background under the existing gradient overlay.
- Rotation strategy for N sources:
  - Track `activeIndex` (currently visible/playing source) and `nextIndex = (activeIndex + 1) % sources.length`.
  - Track `activeLayer` as `'A' | 'B'` to know which DOM video is currently on top.
  - The hidden layer preloads `sources[nextIndex]` with `preload="auto"`, waits for `canplay`.
- Transition trigger:
  - Either on `timeupdate` when `remainingTime <= thresholdMs` (e.g., 300ms) or on `ended` as fallback.
  - Start crossfade when the next layer reports `canplay` (or after small timeout fallback).
- Swap sequence (typical):
  1) Active layer is playing video i. Hidden layer sets `src` to video i+1, `preload="auto"`, `muted`, `playsInline`.
  2) Hidden layer awaits `canplay` and `play()` promise resolution.
  3) Crossfade: set hidden layer `opacity: 1` and active layer `opacity: 0` over 300–400ms.
  4) On `transitionend`, pause the now-hidden old layer, clear its `src` or leave as-is, then flip `activeLayer`.
  5) Update `activeIndex = nextIndex`, compute new `nextIndex`, and begin preloading the subsequent video.

### React Hook (optional, for reuse)
- `useVideoCrossfade({ sources, crossfadeMs = 320, preloadAhead = 1, nearEndThresholdMs = 300 })`
  - Returns: `{ activeLayer, activeIndex, nextIndex, bindLayerA, bindLayerB, onContainerRef }`
  - `bindLayerX` supplies refs, `src`, and event handlers to each `<video>`.
  - Handles canplay, timeupdate, ended, and play promise errors internally.
  - Automatically works for any `sources.length >= 1`.

### CSS
- `.HeroVideoLayer` shared styles: absolute, inset: 0, width/height 100%, `object-fit: cover`, `transition: opacity 320ms ease`.
- `.isVisible { opacity: 1; }` and `.isHidden { opacity: 0; }`
- Ensure `.HeroVideoContainer { background: #000; }` plus existing gradient via `::after`.

### Attributes and readiness
- Both videos: `autoPlay`, `muted`, `playsInline`, optional `disablePictureInPicture`.
- Use `preload="auto"` on the hidden (next) layer; the visible layer can remain default.
- Add a `poster` image (first frame or thumbnail) for each source to mask initial load on first paint.

### Error handling and fallbacks
- If `canplay` hasn’t fired within 1.5s after preparing next, start crossfade anyway (poster + black bg ensure no grey).
- Always catch `video.play()` promise rejections to avoid unhandled promise rejections on mobile.
- On `saveData` connections, reduce preloading (e.g., only preload metadata) or skip preloading entirely.

### Extensibility
- Adding more videos is just updating the `sources` array.
- Hook-based approach can be reused in other sections if needed.
- Crossfade duration can be themed via CSS variable.

### Testing and Verification
- Manual: throttle network, verify no grey flash; test desktop Chrome/Edge/Safari and mobile Safari/Chrome.
- Visual: add a quick Storybook story or a Playwright snapshot around transition timing.
- Performance: check CPU/GPU via Chrome Performance while looping transitions for 30s.

### Success Criteria (measurable)
- No visible grey/blank frame between videos on standard and throttled 3G Fast profiles.
- Crossfade appears smooth (no stutter) at ~60fps on mid-range devices.
- Adding/removing sources requires no code changes beyond editing the array.
- No uncaught promise rejections or console errors across major browsers.

## Current Status / Progress Tracking

- Planning updated to include continuous hero loop and gallery instant-feel. Awaiting go-ahead to execute step 1 (set black background and add head preloads).

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

- Before implementing the crossfade:
  - Confirm preferred crossfade duration (e.g., 300–400ms).
  - Confirm we should gate aggressive preloads when `navigator.connection.saveData === true`.
  - Confirm how many gallery images to prefetch ahead (recommend 2).
  - Confirm that the optional service worker is out of scope (excluded as requested).

## Lessons

- Swapping `src` on a single `<video>` risks visible blank frames; pre-buffer and crossfade to avoid.
- Use explicit container backgrounds to prevent the browser default grey from flashing through.
# Background and Motivation
The user wants contact info in the footer (email and phone) to copy to the clipboard when clicked, working reliably across devices and browsers, with a clean, non-intrusive UI confirmation that matches the current aesthetic.

# Key Challenges and Analysis
- Cross-browser/device clipboard support: prefer `navigator.clipboard.writeText`, with fallback to a hidden textarea + `document.execCommand('copy')` for older/iOS cases.
- Accessibility: Click targets should be keyboard-navigable and appropriately labeled without altering the current look.
- UI feedback: Subtle confirmation (small inline pill/tooltip) that fades out; avoid layout shift and visual noise.
- Styling consistency: Match CSS Modules approach, fonts ("roboto", "montserrat"), and minimal black/white palette.

# High-level Task Breakdown
1) Implement cross-device clipboard utility
   - Success: Utility tries modern API and falls back gracefully; returns boolean for success/failure.

2) Make footer contact items clickable and accessible
   - Success: Email and phone are rendered as accessible controls with keyboard support and no visual regression.

3) Add subtle inline "Copied" UI matching style
   - Success: On success, a small pill/tooltip shows for ~2s near the item, using existing fonts/colors, with gentle fade.

4) Cross-device verification
   - Success: Manual test on desktop Chrome + mobile Safari/Chrome confirms copy works and confirmation displays; no console errors.

# Project Status Board
- [ ] Implement cross-device clipboard copy utility
- [ ] Make footer contact items clickable and accessible
- [ ] Add subtle inline "Copied" UI matching styles
- [ ] Cross-device manual test (desktop Chrome, iOS Safari, Android Chrome)

# Current Status / Progress Tracking
Planning drafted. Awaiting mode selection (Planner vs Executor) to proceed.

# Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
None currently. Will request if clipboard API restrictions arise in specific environments.

# Lessons
- Prefer feature detection for clipboard with a robust fallback for older browsers and iOS Safari.
Background and Motivation
The hero section uses a video that should be 100% width within its container and vertically centered, with the top and bottom cropped when the video’s height exceeds the container height. Currently, CSS forces a portrait aspect ratio and lacks container overflow control, leading to inconsistent cropping/centering behavior.

Key Challenges and Analysis
- The element `.HeroVideo` has `aspect-ratio: 9/16`, which forces a portrait frame irrespective of the actual media. This can create excessive height and unexpected overflow.
- The container `.HeroVideoContainer` has a fixed `height: 300px` but no `overflow: hidden`. This allows the video element to extend beyond the container rather than be cleanly cropped.
- `object-fit: cover` is applied on the video, but because the video element itself isn’t constrained to the container’s height (no `height: 100%` or positioning), the effect can be misleading.
- Desired behavior: width fills the container; if the video is taller than the container, crop top/bottom equally and keep content centered.

High-level Task Breakdown
1) Implement minimal CSS changes to achieve behavior (Option A: Flex + Overflow Hidden)
   - Remove `aspect-ratio` from `.HeroVideo`.
   - Add `overflow: hidden; position: relative; display: flex; align-items: center;` to `.HeroVideoContainer`.
   - Keep `.HeroVideo { width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; }` so width is authoritative and vertical centering is handled by flex.
   - Success: Video fills width, remains centered vertically, top/bottom are cropped symmetrically when taller than the container.

2) Alternative (Option B: object-fit cover with explicit height)
   - `.HeroVideoContainer { overflow: hidden; position: relative; }`
   - `.HeroVideo { width: 100%; height: 100%; object-fit: cover; }`
   - Success: Same visual result, relies on explicit element height instead of flex centering.

3) Fallback (Option C: Absolute center + min-dimensions)
   - Absolute center the video and use `min-width: 100%; min-height: 100%` to guarantee coverage.
   - Success: Robust across odd cases; slightly more CSS.

4) Responsiveness pass
   - If needed, adjust `.HeroVideoContainer` height responsively, e.g., `height: clamp(240px, 40vw, 520px)`.
   - Success: Good look across mobile/desktop without manual pixel tweaks.

Project Status Board
- [ ] Decide between Option A (flex) and Option B (object-fit with explicit height)
- [ ] Implement chosen option in `src/components/sections/hero/hero.module.css`
- [ ] Verify at common breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- [ ] Optional: make container height responsive

Current Status / Progress Tracking
- Analysis complete. Root causes identified (`aspect-ratio: 9/16` on `.HeroVideo`, missing `overflow: hidden` on container). Ready to implement minimal-change Option A.

Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
- Confirm preferred approach:
  - Option A (flex + overflow hidden, width 100%, height auto) — minimal, readable.
  - Option B (object-fit cover with explicit height: 100%) — also minimal, ties video box to container height directly.
- Confirm whether to keep container height fixed at 300px or switch to a responsive height (e.g., `clamp(240px, 40vw, 520px)`).

Lessons
- Avoid forcing `aspect-ratio` on media elements unless the intent is to impose a synthetic frame; prefer letting intrinsic media ratio drive sizing and let the container control cropping.
- For predictable cropping, set the container to `overflow: hidden` and then either flex-center the media or use `height: 100%` with `object-fit: cover`.

New Task: Make the text area under the hero video have a white background

Key Constraints and Observations
- Current markup places the title in `.HeroTitle` and the button inside `.HeroContactButtonContainer` (unstyled). No dedicated wrapper for both exists, so creating a single white band may be easier with a wrapper.
- Minimal-change approach can style existing blocks without JSX changes, but a wrapper yields cleaner structure and fewer repeated styles.

Options
1) Minimal (no JSX changes):
   - Add `background: #fff;` to `.HeroTitle` and also style `.HeroContactButtonContainer` with the same background to read as one band.
   - Add spacing: `padding` and perhaps `border-top` to visually separate from the video.
   - Success: The area under the video where text lives appears with a white background.

2) Clean structure (small JSX change):
   - Wrap `.HeroTitle` and `.HeroContactButtonContainer` in a new `div` named `.HeroTextArea`.
   - CSS for `.HeroTextArea`: `background: #fff; width: 100%;` plus `padding` and optional `border-radius`.
   - Success: A single white band below the video containing both title and button, simpler to maintain.

3) Section-level approach:
   - If the entire area below `.HeroVideoContainer` should be white, set a white background on a sibling block spanning full width.
   - Success: Clear separation; use if more content is planned beneath the video.

Recommended
- Option 2 for maintainability. If you prefer zero JSX edits, Option 1 works.

Success Criteria
- The visible area directly below the video containing the title and button shows a solid white background across mobile and desktop widths.

Project Status Board
- [ ] Choose Option 1 (CSS-only) or Option 2 (wrapper + CSS)
- [ ] Implement CSS and verify spacing, contrast, and readability

Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
- Confirm preferred option (1: CSS-only, 2: wrapper), desired padding (e.g., 16–24px), and whether the white band should be full-width or constrained.

Lessons
- Grouping related UI into a wrapper simplifies styling repeated backgrounds and spacing compared to styling individual items.

# ServiceCard Show More / Show Less Toggle

## Background and Motivation

Service descriptions can be lengthy and currently display in full, which creates visual clutter and pushes important information (like pricing) down the page. A per-card collapsible section with a Show more / Show less toggle will keep the layout compact while allowing users to reveal details on demand.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

- The existing `ServiceCard` is a simple presentational component without state. It renders `title`, `contents` (array of strings), and `price`.
- We need a clean, accessible, and performant collapse/expand pattern without layout jumps.
- Height animation for unknown content height is tricky. Animating `height` from `0` to `auto` is not directly supported. Two pragmatic choices:
  - CSS `max-height` with a sufficiently large value plus `overflow: hidden` and a `transition` on `max-height`.
  - JS-measured height (using `scrollHeight`) and inline styles. This is more precise but introduces extra code/refs.
- The toggle should sit to the right of the title, read clearly, and be keyboard and screen-reader accessible (`<button>` with `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`).
- Maintain visual appeal: subtle transition, spacing that looks intentional, and a clear affordance (text plus caret/chevron if available).

## Recommended Approach

- Local state per `ServiceCard` with `useState<boolean>` for `isExpanded` (default: `false`). Keeps concerns contained; parent (`Services`) remains unchanged.
- Title row wrapper `ServiceCardHeader` using flex to place the title left and the toggle button right.
- Content container gets two modifier classes: `expanded` and `collapsed`, implemented via `max-height` transition and `overflow: hidden`. Use a conservative large `max-height` (e.g., `max-height: 1000px`) to cover longest content.
- Add `aria-expanded` on the button and `id`/`aria-controls` wiring for accessibility. Button text toggles between "Show more" and "Show less".
- Keep `price` always visible underneath the contents so pricing remains discoverable whether collapsed or expanded.

## High-level Task Breakdown

1) Structure updates in `src/components/ui/serviceCard/serviceCard.tsx`
   - Add `isExpanded` state and `toggle` handler.
   - Wrap title and toggle in a new header container: `div.ServiceCardHeader`.
   - Add a `button.ServiceCardToggle` to the right of the title with proper ARIA attributes.
   - Apply `expanded`/`collapsed` classes to the contents container based on state.
   - Success: Clicking the button toggles state and updates button label and ARIA attributes.

2) Styling in `src/components/ui/serviceCard/serviceCard.module.css`
   - Add `.ServiceCardHeader` (flex row, space-between, center-aligned).
   - Style `.ServiceCardToggle` (minimal, brand-consistent; no default button chrome; hover/active states; focus ring visible).
   - Animate contents via `.ServiceCardContents` + modifiers:
     - Base: `overflow: hidden; transition: max-height 300ms ease; will-change: max-height;`
     - `.expanded { max-height: 1000px; }`
     - `.collapsed { max-height: 0; }`
   - Ensure list spacing remains good when collapsed (avoid extra bottom margin bleeding). Optionally use a gradient fade if desired later.
   - Success: Smooth open/close animation with no layout jump and tidy spacing.

3) Accessibility and semantics
   - Use a semantic `<button>`, not a `div`.
   - Add `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls` linking to the contents container `id`.
   - Keyboard operable and visible focus outline.
   - Success: Toggle is accessible and state is announced to screen readers.

4) Testing (lightweight)
   - Write a React Testing Library test (if testing infra exists) that:
     - Renders a `ServiceCard` with >3 items, verifies contents container is collapsed by default (e.g., has `collapsed` class).
     - Clicks toggle and expects `expanded` class and visible items.
     - Clicks again and expects collapse.
   - If no test infra, perform manual checks across breakpoints.
   - Success: Behavior verified programmatically or manually.

## Project Status Board

- [x] Update structure/state in `serviceCard.tsx`
- [x] Add and refine CSS in `serviceCard.module.css`
- [ ] Manual visual QA: mobile, tablet, desktop
- [ ] Optional: Add automated tests if infra present

## Current Status / Progress Tracking

- Step 1 implemented: added `isExpanded` state, header row with toggle button, ARIA wiring, and content container modifiers.
- CSS added: header layout, toggle button styling, and `max-height` transition with `data-expanded` attribute.
- Refinement: Ensure toggle aligns with the first line of the title and remains single-line height (`align-items: flex-start` on header, `align-self: flex-start`, `line-height: 1`, and compact `padding` on button).

— Step 2: Manual Visual QA (In Progress)
- Verify default state: All cards collapsed on initial load.
- Toggle behavior: Click “Show more” expands smoothly; “Show less” collapses smoothly with no layout jumps.
- Price visibility: Price remains visible in both states.
- Alignment: Title and toggle look visually balanced across single-line and multi-line titles per current design preference.
- Keyboard: Tab focuses the toggle; Enter/Space toggles expansion.
- Responsiveness: Behavior and spacing look good on mobile, tablet, and desktop widths.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

- Please run through the Step 2 checklist above and report any visual issues (spacing, timing, alignment). I’ll refine immediately based on your feedback.

- Confirm button text preference:
  - Option A: "Show more" / "Show less"
  - Option B: Add chevron (CSS pseudo-element) that rotates on toggle
- Confirm default state per card (collapsed by default recommended). Any card(s) you want expanded by default?

## Lessons

- For simple collapses, CSS `max-height` transitions are clean and performant enough without measurement refs.
- Use semantic buttons with ARIA to keep toggles obvious and accessible.
