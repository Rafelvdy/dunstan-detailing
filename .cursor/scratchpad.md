Background and Motivation
The hero section uses a video that should be 100% width within its container and vertically centered, with the top and bottom cropped when the video’s height exceeds the container height. Currently, CSS forces a portrait aspect ratio and lacks container overflow control, leading to inconsistent cropping/centering behavior.

Key Challenges and Analysis
- The element `.HeroVideo` has `aspect-ratio: 9/16`, which forces a portrait frame irrespective of the actual media. This can create excessive height and unexpected overflow.
- The container `.HeroVideoContainer` has a fixed `height: 300px` but no `overflow: hidden`. This allows the video element to extend beyond the container rather than be cleanly cropped.
- `object-fit: cover` is applied on the video, but because the video element itself isn’t constrained to the container’s height (no `height: 100%` or positioning), the effect can be misleading.
- Desired behavior: width fills the container; if the video is taller than the container, crop top/bottom equally and keep content centered.

High-level Task Breakdown
1) Implement minimal CSS changes to achieve behavior (Option A: Flex + Overflow Hidden)
   - Remove `aspect-ratio` from `.HeroVideo`.
   - Add `overflow: hidden; position: relative; display: flex; align-items: center;` to `.HeroVideoContainer`.
   - Keep `.HeroVideo { width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; }` so width is authoritative and vertical centering is handled by flex.
   - Success: Video fills width, remains centered vertically, top/bottom are cropped symmetrically when taller than the container.

2) Alternative (Option B: object-fit cover with explicit height)
   - `.HeroVideoContainer { overflow: hidden; position: relative; }`
   - `.HeroVideo { width: 100%; height: 100%; object-fit: cover; }`
   - Success: Same visual result, relies on explicit element height instead of flex centering.

3) Fallback (Option C: Absolute center + min-dimensions)
   - Absolute center the video and use `min-width: 100%; min-height: 100%` to guarantee coverage.
   - Success: Robust across odd cases; slightly more CSS.

4) Responsiveness pass
   - If needed, adjust `.HeroVideoContainer` height responsively, e.g., `height: clamp(240px, 40vw, 520px)`.
   - Success: Good look across mobile/desktop without manual pixel tweaks.

Project Status Board
- [ ] Decide between Option A (flex) and Option B (object-fit with explicit height)
- [ ] Implement chosen option in `src/components/sections/hero/hero.module.css`
- [ ] Verify at common breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- [ ] Optional: make container height responsive

Current Status / Progress Tracking
- Analysis complete. Root causes identified (`aspect-ratio: 9/16` on `.HeroVideo`, missing `overflow: hidden` on container). Ready to implement minimal-change Option A.

Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
- Confirm preferred approach:
  - Option A (flex + overflow hidden, width 100%, height auto) — minimal, readable.
  - Option B (object-fit cover with explicit height: 100%) — also minimal, ties video box to container height directly.
- Confirm whether to keep container height fixed at 300px or switch to a responsive height (e.g., `clamp(240px, 40vw, 520px)`).

Lessons
- Avoid forcing `aspect-ratio` on media elements unless the intent is to impose a synthetic frame; prefer letting intrinsic media ratio drive sizing and let the container control cropping.
- For predictable cropping, set the container to `overflow: hidden` and then either flex-center the media or use `height: 100%` with `object-fit: cover`.

New Task: Make the text area under the hero video have a white background

Key Constraints and Observations
- Current markup places the title in `.HeroTitle` and the button inside `.HeroContactButtonContainer` (unstyled). No dedicated wrapper for both exists, so creating a single white band may be easier with a wrapper.
- Minimal-change approach can style existing blocks without JSX changes, but a wrapper yields cleaner structure and fewer repeated styles.

Options
1) Minimal (no JSX changes):
   - Add `background: #fff;` to `.HeroTitle` and also style `.HeroContactButtonContainer` with the same background to read as one band.
   - Add spacing: `padding` and perhaps `border-top` to visually separate from the video.
   - Success: The area under the video where text lives appears with a white background.

2) Clean structure (small JSX change):
   - Wrap `.HeroTitle` and `.HeroContactButtonContainer` in a new `div` named `.HeroTextArea`.
   - CSS for `.HeroTextArea`: `background: #fff; width: 100%;` plus `padding` and optional `border-radius`.
   - Success: A single white band below the video containing both title and button, simpler to maintain.

3) Section-level approach:
   - If the entire area below `.HeroVideoContainer` should be white, set a white background on a sibling block spanning full width.
   - Success: Clear separation; use if more content is planned beneath the video.

Recommended
- Option 2 for maintainability. If you prefer zero JSX edits, Option 1 works.

Success Criteria
- The visible area directly below the video containing the title and button shows a solid white background across mobile and desktop widths.

Project Status Board
- [ ] Choose Option 1 (CSS-only) or Option 2 (wrapper + CSS)
- [ ] Implement CSS and verify spacing, contrast, and readability

Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
- Confirm preferred option (1: CSS-only, 2: wrapper), desired padding (e.g., 16–24px), and whether the white band should be full-width or constrained.

Lessons
- Grouping related UI into a wrapper simplifies styling repeated backgrounds and spacing compared to styling individual items.

# ServiceCard Show More / Show Less Toggle

## Background and Motivation

Service descriptions can be lengthy and currently display in full, which creates visual clutter and pushes important information (like pricing) down the page. A per-card collapsible section with a Show more / Show less toggle will keep the layout compact while allowing users to reveal details on demand.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

- The existing `ServiceCard` is a simple presentational component without state. It renders `title`, `contents` (array of strings), and `price`.
- We need a clean, accessible, and performant collapse/expand pattern without layout jumps.
- Height animation for unknown content height is tricky. Animating `height` from `0` to `auto` is not directly supported. Two pragmatic choices:
  - CSS `max-height` with a sufficiently large value plus `overflow: hidden` and a `transition` on `max-height`.
  - JS-measured height (using `scrollHeight`) and inline styles. This is more precise but introduces extra code/refs.
- The toggle should sit to the right of the title, read clearly, and be keyboard and screen-reader accessible (`<button>` with `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`).
- Maintain visual appeal: subtle transition, spacing that looks intentional, and a clear affordance (text plus caret/chevron if available).

## Recommended Approach

- Local state per `ServiceCard` with `useState<boolean>` for `isExpanded` (default: `false`). Keeps concerns contained; parent (`Services`) remains unchanged.
- Title row wrapper `ServiceCardHeader` using flex to place the title left and the toggle button right.
- Content container gets two modifier classes: `expanded` and `collapsed`, implemented via `max-height` transition and `overflow: hidden`. Use a conservative large `max-height` (e.g., `max-height: 1000px`) to cover longest content.
- Add `aria-expanded` on the button and `id`/`aria-controls` wiring for accessibility. Button text toggles between "Show more" and "Show less".
- Keep `price` always visible underneath the contents so pricing remains discoverable whether collapsed or expanded.

## High-level Task Breakdown

1) Structure updates in `src/components/ui/serviceCard/serviceCard.tsx`
   - Add `isExpanded` state and `toggle` handler.
   - Wrap title and toggle in a new header container: `div.ServiceCardHeader`.
   - Add a `button.ServiceCardToggle` to the right of the title with proper ARIA attributes.
   - Apply `expanded`/`collapsed` classes to the contents container based on state.
   - Success: Clicking the button toggles state and updates button label and ARIA attributes.

2) Styling in `src/components/ui/serviceCard/serviceCard.module.css`
   - Add `.ServiceCardHeader` (flex row, space-between, center-aligned).
   - Style `.ServiceCardToggle` (minimal, brand-consistent; no default button chrome; hover/active states; focus ring visible).
   - Animate contents via `.ServiceCardContents` + modifiers:
     - Base: `overflow: hidden; transition: max-height 300ms ease; will-change: max-height;`
     - `.expanded { max-height: 1000px; }`
     - `.collapsed { max-height: 0; }`
   - Ensure list spacing remains good when collapsed (avoid extra bottom margin bleeding). Optionally use a gradient fade if desired later.
   - Success: Smooth open/close animation with no layout jump and tidy spacing.

3) Accessibility and semantics
   - Use a semantic `<button>`, not a `div`.
   - Add `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls` linking to the contents container `id`.
   - Keyboard operable and visible focus outline.
   - Success: Toggle is accessible and state is announced to screen readers.

4) Testing (lightweight)
   - Write a React Testing Library test (if testing infra exists) that:
     - Renders a `ServiceCard` with >3 items, verifies contents container is collapsed by default (e.g., has `collapsed` class).
     - Clicks toggle and expects `expanded` class and visible items.
     - Clicks again and expects collapse.
   - If no test infra, perform manual checks across breakpoints.
   - Success: Behavior verified programmatically or manually.

## Project Status Board

- [x] Update structure/state in `serviceCard.tsx`
- [x] Add and refine CSS in `serviceCard.module.css`
- [ ] Manual visual QA: mobile, tablet, desktop
- [ ] Optional: Add automated tests if infra present

## Current Status / Progress Tracking

- Step 1 implemented: added `isExpanded` state, header row with toggle button, ARIA wiring, and content container modifiers.
- CSS added: header layout, toggle button styling, and `max-height` transition with `data-expanded` attribute.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

- Confirm button text preference:
  - Option A: "Show more" / "Show less"
  - Option B: Add chevron (CSS pseudo-element) that rotates on toggle
- Confirm default state per card (collapsed by default recommended). Any card(s) you want expanded by default?

## Lessons

- For simple collapses, CSS `max-height` transitions are clean and performant enough without measurement refs.
- Use semantic buttons with ARIA to keep toggles obvious and accessible.
